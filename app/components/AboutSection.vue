        End Your Year Strong (EYYS) is an annual end-of-year Christian retreat where believers gather
        to seek Godâ€™s face, receive revelation, and align with divine purpose for the new year. Over 5 days,
        participants engage in powerful sessions of prayer, worship, and deep teachings rooted in Scripture.
        Born from a passion to see lives transformed and destinies unlocked, EYYS has grown into a spiritual
        encounter where the weary are refreshed, the hungry are filled, and vision is reignited.
